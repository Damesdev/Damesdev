- 👋 Hi, I’m @Damesdev
- 👀 I’m interested in Barbecueing, Sports, Machine Learning, and building things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github, Python, Data and Privacy, and go down the rabbit hole of coding languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything beginner level that can be useful for data analytics or building tools to help.
